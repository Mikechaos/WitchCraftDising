# [TodoMVC using React + Flux](https://github.com/shaohua/todomvc-react-flux-backbone)

## The Flux part is implemented with Backbone components, hence different from [Facebook's official example](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples/todomvc-flux)
- the dispatcher uses Backbone.Events
- the store uses Backbone.Model

## Running
    npm install
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    grunt

Then visit: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
